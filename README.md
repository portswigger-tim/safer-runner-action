# Safer Runner Action

Network security layer for GitHub Actions runners using DNS filtering (Quad9) and iptables rules. Implements default-deny policy: only explicitly permitted domains are accessible.

## Features

- **Dual modes**: `analyze` (monitoring) or `enforce` (blocking)
- **DNS filtering**: DNSMasq with Quad9 upstream resolver
- **Firewall rules**: iptables prevents DNS bypass via direct IP connections
- **Custom domains**: Add trusted domains via input parameter
- **Automatic reporting**: Network access provenance in job summaries
- **Risky subdomain blocking**: Blocks gist.github.com and raw.githubusercontent.com by default in enforce mode

## Usage

### Analyze mode (default)

```yaml
- uses: portswigger-tim/safer-runner-action@v1
- run: |
    curl https://example.com  # Logged but not blocked
```

### Enforce mode

```yaml
- uses: portswigger-tim/safer-runner-action@v1
  with:
    mode: 'enforce'
    allowed-domains: |
      example.com
      api.trusted-service.com
- run: |
    curl https://api.trusted-service.com  # ‚úÖ Allowed
    curl https://malicious.com  # ‚ùå Blocked
```

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `mode` | `analyze` (log only) or `enforce` (block) | `analyze` |
| `allowed-domains` | Additional domains to allow | `''` |
| `fail-on-tampering` | Fail workflow if security config is tampered | `false` |
| `block-risky-github-subdomains` | Block gist.github.com and raw.githubusercontent.com in enforce mode | `true` |

## How It Works

1. Installs `dnsmasq` and `ipset` packages
2. Configures iptables rules to control outbound traffic
3. Configures system DNS to use local DNSMasq instance
4. Sets up DNS policy with Quad9 upstream resolver
5. Starts DNSMasq and applies security rules
6. Post-action analyzes logs and generates network access report

GitHub Actions required domains are pre-configured and automatically allowed.

## Network Access Reports

Job summaries include a Network Access Provenance table showing:

- Domain/IP addresses accessed
- Ports used
- Status (‚úÖ Allowed, ‚ùå Denied, üìä Analyzed)
- Source (GitHub Required, User Defined)

In analyze mode, the report suggests an `allowed-domains` configuration based on non-GitHub domains accessed, making it easy to transition to enforce mode.

## Security Model

### Analyze Mode
- All DNS queries logged but allowed
- DNS queries, firewall activity, and connection attempts are logged
- Workflow continues normally while collecting security intelligence

### Enforce Mode
- All DNS queries return NXDOMAIN unless explicitly allowed
- iptables rules prevent bypassing DNS filtering
- Only allowed domains accessible

### Both Modes
- Azure metadata service access preserved (required for GitHub Actions)
- Return traffic for established connections allowed

## Limitations

Network filtering provides a first line of defense but has limitations. Sophisticated attackers may attempt:

- **Data exfiltration via allowed domains**: Abuse GitHub/npm/PyPI to upload secrets
- **DNS tunneling**: Encode data in DNS queries
- **Local file system attacks**: Stage data for later exfiltration
- **Process/system call abuse**: Container escapes, privilege escalation

### Defense in Depth

Combine with additional security layers:

- **Runtime security**: Falco, Tracee
- **Container security**: Distroless images, read-only filesystems, non-root users
- **Secrets management**: GitHub secrets, secure credential handling
- **Dependency scanning**: Snyk, Dependabot, GitHub native scanning
- **Action security**: Pin to commits, use trusted publishers

## Debugging

View DNS and firewall logs:

```bash
sudo grep -E 'Processing: |GitHub-Allow: |User-Allow: |Drop-Enforce: |Allow-Analyze: ' /var/log/syslog
```
